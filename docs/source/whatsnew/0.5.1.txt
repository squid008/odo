New Features
------------

* When an edge fails in ``convert`` we will now consider both the path from the
  source to the target with the broken edge removed as well as the path from the
  current value to the target. This can prevent a lot of duplicated work when
  the new path shares a prefix with the original path (:issue:`449`).
